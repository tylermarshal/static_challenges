        <p>I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected. I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words.
        <p>The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! This placeholder text is gonna be HUGE. Lorem Ipsum is FAKE TEXT! I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things.</p>
        <p>Trump Ipsum is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslim text entering your website. I write the best placeholder text, and I'm the biggest developer on the web by far... While that's mock-ups and this is politics, are they really so different? You could see there was text coming out of her eyes, text coming out of her wherever. That other text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10.</p>

        <p>If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it. Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't. My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women. I write the best placeholder text, and I'm the biggest developer on the web by far... While that's mock-ups and this is politics, are they really so different?</p>
